# pcap_scrapping

Scripts for the processing of PCAPs using
python scripts using scapy + opencv to process pcaps


### Prerequisites
scapy       -- pcap processing 
pandas      -- dataframe
binascii 
pathlib
progressbar -- Provides visual justification to upgrade hardware
tkinter     -- because why not

### How-To
I would recommend to put pcap into data folder
Select the file, then it automatically runs... sorry
